Knife plugin for [Chef][chef] to draw dependency graphs for roles that have become spaghetti.

## Installation

#### Requirements

Ruby 1.9.2 and higher.

This plugin requires on [Graphviz][graphviz], and should be installed prior to
installing the plugin.

Graphviz may be obtained through a variety of methods. On OSX an easy method is
via [Homebrew][homebrew]:

    $ brew install graphviz

### Gem install, via RubyGems:

    $ gem install knife-role-spaghetti

## Usage

**NOTE:** Ensure that your `knife.rb` has the `role_path` setting configured.

Since this is a [Knife][knife] plugin, execution should be performed in your Chef repository.

Execute:

    $ knife role spaghetti

with no arguments should result in a new file named `role-spaghetti.png` in your
repo root.

    $ knife role spaghetti "/tmp/someotherfilename.png"

will place the file in the specified location.

Execute `knife role spaghetti -h` for more options.

## Examples
From a [sample role][sample role jt], courtesy of @jtimberman, along with one from the [Opscode Wiki][sample role wiki], plus one more cyclic role model, produces this image:

![Sample Roles][sample roles]

(full resolution [here](http://cl.ly/image/1C0Q3p0y093s))

Running through the neato renderer (with the `-N` switch) produces this image:

![Sample Roles Neato][sample roles neato]
